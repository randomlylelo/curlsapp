# Contributing to Curls App

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Curls App! We welcome contributions that align with our philosophy of simplicity, privacy, and beautiful design.

## üéØ Our Philosophy

Before contributing, please understand our core principles:
- **Simplicity First**: Features should be intuitive and accessible to beginners
- **Privacy by Design**: No cloud dependencies, analytics, or data collection
- **Beautiful Inside and Out**: Clean code and clean UI, following Steve Jobs' design philosophy
- **Zero Dependencies**: We use only native iOS frameworks

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/[your-username]/curlsapp.git
   cd curlsapp
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Install Xcode (latest version)
   - Open `curlsapp.xcodeproj`
   - Select iPhone 16 simulator or your device
   - Build and run with `Cmd+R`

3. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow existing SwiftUI patterns and conventions
- Use `@Observable` for state management
- Keep views simple and extract complex logic to ViewModels
- Write self-documenting code (minimal comments)
- Follow feature-based architecture in `Features/` directory

### Testing
Before submitting, ensure:
```bash
# All tests pass
xcodebuild test -project curlsapp.xcodeproj -scheme curlsapp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'

# Project builds successfully
xcodebuild build -project curlsapp.xcodeproj -scheme curlsapp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'
```

### Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Format: `type: brief description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- Example: `feat: add workout pause functionality`

## üé® Design Guidelines

- **Minimalist UI**: Remove anything that doesn't add value
- **Consistent Animations**: Use `AnimationConstants.swift` for timing
- **Accessibility**: Ensure VoiceOver and Dynamic Type support
- **Dark Mode**: Test in both light and dark appearances
- **One-Handed Use**: Optimize for thumb reachability
