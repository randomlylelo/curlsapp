## Project Structure

The app follows a feature-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **`App/`** - Main app entry point and navigation
- **`Features/`** - Feature modules (ExerciseDatabase, Session, History, Templates)
- **`Shared/`** - Shared components, models, and utilities
- **`Resources/`** - Assets and data files
- **`free-exercise-db/`** - Exercise database submodule (MIT licensed), forked from free-exercise-db

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed architecture documentation.
